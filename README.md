    <h1>Stock Market Shenanigans: Can a Python Script Crack the Code on Future Prices?</h1>

    <p>Yeah, we've all been there. The stock market feels like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar high, bouncing around with no rhyme or reason. But fear not, financial fortune seekers! Today, we're unleashing the secret weapon of Wall Street wizards: **Python's Prophetic Powers!**</p>

    <p>Forget Nostradamus' cryptic rhymes and your lucky rabbit's foot (sorry, Thumper). We're talking **hardcore data analysis**, baby! Using Python's magical NumPy library, we're gonna crunch numbers like a sumo wrestler at an all-you-can-eat ramen buffet.</p>

    <p>But here's the twist: it's not just about throwing all the data at Python and hoping for the best. We're talking **training timeframes** here. Think of it like teaching your financial Yoda. Do you give him all the market wisdom from day one, or do you start with kindergarten level ("Buy low, sell high, duh!") and work your way up to Jedi Master ("Predict market crashes like you predict your lunch order")?</p>

    <h2>Three Epic Training Scenarios: Choose Your Jedi Master!</h2>

    <h3>1. The All-Knowing Oracle</h3>

    <p>We feed Python the entire market saga, from 2013 to present day. This Yoda's seen it all, from dot-com bubbles to meme stock madness. But is he too bogged down by ancient history to see the future clearly? Think Gandalf the Grey before he got his fireworks upgrade.</p>

    <h3>2. The Five-Year Flashback</h3>

    <p>We give Python a more recent crash course, just the past five years. Think of him as a young Obi-Wan, full of energy and ready to tackle the latest market trends. But can he handle the curveballs the future throws? Like Spider-Man learning to swing without Uncle Ben's wise words.</p>

    <h3>3. The Two-Year Tornado</h3>

    <p>Buckle up, because this Python's training wheels are off! We're talking the hottest, freshest market data, the last two years of pure financial frenzy. He's like a hyperactive Deadpool predicting stock swings faster than you can say "chimichanga." </p>

    <h2>So, who will win the crown? The seasoned oracle, the energetic Jedi Knight, or the whirlwind Padawan?</h2>
